2. **Open Developer Console**

   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + Option + J` (Mac)  
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + K`  

3. **Copy & Paste** the script into the console and press **Enter**.  

4. Watch the console logs as the script runs.  


## Controls

Each script attaches a control object to the `window`:

| Action        | Object      | Methods Available |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Unfollow      | `liUnfollow` | `.start()` `.stop()` `.status()` |
| Unlike        | `liUnlike`   | `.start()` `.stop()` `.status()` |
| Delete Comment| `liDelCmt`   | `.start()` `.stop()` `.status()` |

### Example  
```js
liDelCmt.stop()     // Immediately stop deleting comments
liDelCmt.start()    // Resume from current state
liDelCmt.status()   // Show stats (deleted count, remaining, etc.)
```


### Notes & Recommendations
- Delays are built in (~1.2‚Äì1.5s per action). Increase if LinkedIn rate-limits you.
- Batch Mode: Set maxPerRun in the script to process only a limited number (e.g., 25 per run).
- Localization: If your LinkedIn is not in English, update text labels ("Following", "Delete", etc.) inside the scripts.
- Scroll Behavior:
- - Unfollow & Unlike ‚Üí auto-scrolls to load more.
  - Delete Comments ‚Üí scrolls only to new posts with your comments (ignores ‚ÄúLoad more comments‚Äù so it doesn‚Äôt touch other people‚Äôs threads).


### Example Run
```
Delete my comments started. Use liDelCmt.stop() to halt.
Found 3 of your comments
Deleting comment‚Ä¶
Finished. Deleted 3 comments.
```
